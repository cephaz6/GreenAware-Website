Welcome to the GreenAware website repository!

GreenAware is a UK-based charity, concerned with the climate changes caused by
Global Warming. GreenAware focuses on data collection to enhance public
awareness and support scientific research. Their mission is to empower citizen
scientists and leverage collected data for predictive modeling initiatives that
ultimately influence government policy. This public repository houses the codes
and documentation for the Greenaware website, a platform designed to be at the
forefront of these efforts. Scientists and/or trained personnels can register,
contribute climate readings and observations related to their local regions, and
also access valuable information and resources.
